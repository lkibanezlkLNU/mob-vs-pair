Interviewer: What is your name and what's the role in your company?

[Int1]: Hey, my name is [Int1] and uh, I work as a as a software developer and Scrum master at [company].

Interviewer: How many years have you worked as a programmer?

[Int1]: 3, maybe 4 soon

Interviewer: If you could use your own words, how would you define pair and mob programming?

[Int1]: Yeah, as a as a set of rules, not rules but it's a way for multiple people to program together and trying to get everyone's ideas together. Heard, I guess.

Interviewer: Can you give me a short summary of your experience with group programming which includes both Pair and Mob?

[Int1]: Yeah, I've done a fair bit of pair programming both at work but also in in my free time with friends. And I did some training, uh, with one of the founders of mob programming, I don't recall his name at the top of my head

Interviewer: I think you are talking about Woody Zuill.

[Int1]: Yeah, Woody Zuill, he was attending at [company] and I was part of that group. And I also have some but very little experience with MOB programming in in the Woody Zuill sense.

Interviewer: How about your company that you work in now? How are the two programming practices were used in there?

[Int1]: I think it's very, very team dependent and well, what kind of personalities you have in the team. In my team, me and a colleague is doing a lot of pair programming and it sometimes goes to a mob if the definition of a mob is more than two people. And often in those cases is when me and my colleague gets stuck on something and we need to call in some help. But then we tried when I started out as a Scrum master in my team, I tried to do much more mobile programming, but then it didn't work out very well, I would say.

Interviewer: You said that it depends on the team and it on the team, and the decision of picking Mob/Pair is based on their personalities, who you think makes the decision whether it fits the team or not, is it the scrum master?

[Int1]: Yeah, from my point of view, it's more tech lead and the more senior or yeah or the person in the team with the most uh technical plus domain knowledge. 

Interviewer: When you were using mob and their programming, did you see any changes in the efficiency of programming? And by that, I mean the amount of code produced per resource.

[Int1]: Uh, it's uh, it's I think it's very, very hard to say, yeah, I don't think I have a yes or a no yeah.

Interviewer: A lot of people claim that it increases efficiency, however, a lot of people disagree and say that you increase the number - you double the number of resources for pair programming, for example, but you don't halve the time required to produce the code. But a lot of people argue that the technical advantage of having two people looking at one piece of code can outweigh this efficiency.

[Int1]: Yeah, and I mean I think it's depends so much on how - I think it's so many variables and I think three of them are like how is the host the domain knowledge and the technical knowledge of the people attending the group and do you see the mob session as a code review included? So will that go through the peer review process and straight to trunk or domain or developments? I had the third one but I think it's depends so much on those aspects.

Interviewer: The biggest argument to support pair and mob programming is the fact that you reduce the number of errors and faults in the code that you produce. Have you had any experience with this?

[Int1]: Yeah, absolutely. I mean mostly I have that kind of positive experience in my free time, when I pair programming with friends because in those cases, we are both personally engaged, uh personally, interested in the things that we pair programming around, and we often have strong opinions where we can in a constructive way – ‘What if we have done it that way?’ then we can reason about the concepts and we can try it out then we can progress so much faster than if I would sit down by myself in my own space and finding out the problem half a year later because I made a bad architecture or design decision.

Interviewer: Would you say that you get “stuck” less often if you code with someone else, like if you do pair programming or mob programming.

[Int1]: Yeah, and I think that's You take, and you give, in some situations I feel the energy and I feel the thrive to progress further, and when my energy runs out my colleague can step in 

Interviewer: Do you have any other advantages for group programming in the back of your head that you want to mention?

[Int1]: I think bugs, safety, code quality and knowledge sharing and also like the social aspects of people interacting with each other.

Interviewer: Yeah, so I use this word a lot during my thesis it's called camaraderie. Would you say that pair and mob encouraged this or?

[Int1]: I think it depends on the emotional safety of the of the individuals in the in the team, I don't think that mob programming is a tool for team development I think you first need to have a team spirit and you need to have some kind of team feeling and then you can use mob or pair programming as a tool for knowledge sharing. But uhm, yeah, If you have a team where people do not feel emotionally safe to say what they want and behave normally in a group and feel safe in that manner. I think it will be more bad than good.

Interviewer: So that's a really interesting point that you said that mob programming should be started once the team has some sort of synergy. Do you have any counter experience? Like when you tried to use it, but it didn't work because of the lack of teamwork?

[Int1]: I did that in my team, I wanted to use Mob Programming as a tool for team development and it didn’t turn out good. It didn’t turn out bad either but there was no point to it, people were just feeling unsafe, and they didn’t know each other so they didn’t know how to interact

Interviewer: Do you think there's a risk with mob programming that the team members don't participate all the time or use their full potential?

[Int1]: Yes and no. I think it's it depends on what situations, I refer Uncle Bob in this case, I send you a link later, but he talks about the problems, and he talks about when to use Mob and pair. Like in the very simple case where you just like, say that you need to do a text change somewhere, then it's much easier if one person does it and does a PR. And in in the total opposite of that corner is there is a really hard problem where maybe someone need to think closely and really hard and maybe those situations is maybe where people really need to focus and need to do that alone, but in in all of the other aspects, it could be really good for mob programming, because those are there levels where interaction can happen more naturally and you don't need to think that really, really hard.

Interviewer: That's a really nice way to put it. My last question about mob programming specifically is that some experts suggest the use of a facilitator. Do you think this role is really important, or do you think it would be OK to manage it from inside the team?

[Int1]: A very good question. I don't think I have some an answer for that. I think that also really comes down to the team because you need to rotate, and you need to be able to step back from the problem to get a wider angle sometimes. I think a facilitator is very good I think, a person, maybe outside of the team and little bit of knowledge and understanding how to facilitate these kinds of setups.

Interviewer: So moving on to pair programming, do you think a pair should always consist of developers that are around the same level? Or do you think there's a benefit to having drastically different knowledge levels?

[Int1]: Yeah, I think different knowledge levels are OK too. I think both of them are fine. Uh, they may serve different purposes. But I see them as very both of them as very good tools.

Interviewer: What do you think is the biggest risk of using pair programming?

[Int1]: I don't think that there's much risk with it. Maybe that you do it too early in a team and people don't use it at the right moment. But I don't think it's a risk. I think pair programming and mob sessions, if they are good, they always give something. Even if it's, uh, sometimes, uh, uhm, reduced production speed. I mean the safety of the code quality and knowledge sharing is so much more important in the long run than production speed I think.

Interviewer: So now going on to the last part of the interview where we try to compare the two methods, the practices, when you have to choose between pair and mob for a new project, what factors do you have in mind?

[Int1]: I think in most of the cases that I want to use mob programming, it’s because I want to spread knowledge and I want more eyes on the code and more people to reason about the problem and the solution.

[Int1]: Because when if someone has worked in isolation and you come into the PR progress, then it's not so very easy to discuss in the same manner as you have in the in the mob programming session.

Interviewer: Closer to the technical aspect, would you say that there's an easy way to map projects that should be done with a mob and problems that should be fixed with a pair?

[Int1]: No, I think try to use group programming as much as possible. The technical area where it’s used doesn’t matters that much.

Interviewer: OK, and which one of the two practices do you think is better to on board and your team member?

[Int1]: Yeah, maybe pair programming, the reason for that is that it's easier to talk one on one. I think it's more stressful if you're on boarding a new team member and then all of the team is sitting in. I think that comes back to the emotional safety part. If the person is very comfortable in their role and the level of knowledge, they possess then you can approach it differently, but if you’re a little bit more new or you are a little bit unfamiliar with your role it’s more stressful to be in a mob

Interviewer: Can you name any long term benefits of using pair or mob programming? What I mean by long term can be split in two categories, one of them is for the same team and then the other long term is for the company in general, like people who have used this practice, but probably in different teams.

[Int1]: I think you will get better code in the case of readability, and I think you get a better code according to the domain requirements that you get from your product owner because more people are involved in reason about the solution. 

Interviewer: And then do you think these practices can be adapted for remote work and still function properly? Or do you feel like the physical aspect of being close to each other is really important for them?

[Int1]: I don’t think that the aspect of being (physically) close is necessary at all. When the people have come to that level of emotional safety, then everything comes down to the technical tools that allow you to do what you need to do

Interviewer: OK, so now I basically went through most of my questions. I just want to ask you if there's anything else that I that you think I might have missed or overlooked, and you think it's important for my research.

[Int1]: It could be very easy for an organization to adapt or say ‘We should do more Mob Programming because we think that it benefits everyone but I also that there are some people not very interested in doing it. If they are pretty senior and they know the domain and the technical problems that they can solve by themselves then the Mob or Pair Programming sessions are just something that slows them down. So if they don’t understand and respect the values Mob and Pair bring to the team then it’s never going to work

Interviewer: Yeah, I understand the point and it's really interesting.
