Interviewer: What is your name and what is your role in your company?

[Int3]: Yeah, my name is [Int3]. I'm a developer and Scrum master at [company] and I work in the team responsible for our accounting module and our bank integrations.

Interviewer: How many years did you work as a programmer?

[Int3]: 7 1/2 years now.

Interviewer: How would you define pair and mob programming using your own words?

[Int3]: Yeah, a pair programming I would say is when let’s say I have a problem and I feel like I need another person input on it and we don't share the responsibility of coding that much. It's one person coding and one person or being there for the discussion. I would say in mob programming and strict mob programming, I would say that then you have to change who's coding. Even though we don't always do it like that, we have like a mob pair programming situation.

Interviewer: Is it then more similar to like a coding kata, where you have like 1 navigator for a longer period of time?

[Int3]: Yeah, we have tried both styles, but and found what works for us

Interviewer: Can you tell me a short summary of your experience with both pair and mob programming?

[Int3]: Uhm, yeah I have been pair programming for most part of my career. As I see it, like it's always good to have someone else’s opinion on what you're doing, and it lowers the amount of errors in your code. When we have mob programming, it's a similar experience, but even more so since we can have a UX designers, and we can have testers and our product owner. So anyone needed for the issues that we are working with.

Interviewer: How are the two programming practices used inside your company and how often?

[Int3]: I think pair programming is very widespread. If you want to use pair programming or mob programming, you use it. It's up to every team to decide for themselves if they, if that's how they want to work. Mob programming is in the strict sense is not used as much, but, and that's also if the team wants to work like that, then they can do it and. I would say it's maybe five teams or so that they are working more actively with the mob programming.

Interviewer: When it comes to the pros and cons of both practices, so I'm trying to put them together here and call them group programming. Did you see any changes in efficiency of programming while using these two practices? And by efficiency I mean the amount of good code that's outputted per resources, which is employees and time.

[Int3]: Yeah, yeah, I would definitely say that our efficiency went up since most of the time, a single developer doesn't have enough information to solve the problem on their own. And then the time wasted waiting for an answer from someone when you know from the beginning that I need to have this person with me and to solve the problem, and that time can be used for something else. So I would say that productivity went up.

Interviewer: Did you see a difference in the number of errors or defects in the resulting code using these practices?

[Int3]: Yeah, yeah, the defects definitely went down. Since we like these defects where the developer misinterpreted the issue or what the product owner wanted with issue they are no longer a problem and you can also try different solutions and say well, we can solve it like this or we can solve it like in in this fashion and you get a shorter feedback loop so both intentional and unintentional errors went down.

Interviewer: And how do you think these practices affected the team from a communication and teamwork perspective?

[Int3]: I would say people are better at communicating what their intent is. I would say in some cases people or a developer might have forgotten that they're not mob or pair programming, so then they expect that people know what they have been doing. If they have coded on their own, you get used to people knowing what you're doing.

Interviewer: So besides these three big points, which is efficiency and number of defects and communication or teamwork, do you have any other advantages that group programming brings in the back of your head?

[Int3]: More sense of responsibility, I would say for the entire group. Since everyone has elaborated on the solution. You make sure that everyone opinions are heard, I think that's really important that you don't cut someone off when they're saying something, there is pressure expressing an opinion.

Interviewer: Yeah, so we talked about most of the positive aspects, but do you think there are many tradeoffs or disadvantages to using these two?

[Int3]: Uh, yeah, there can be tradeoffs, like for simpler tasks where you don't need that many peoplw, you can waste time on discussing trivial issues or a or a question. We found that if we had like strict pair programming, with defined times for who's a driver and who's a navigator, we lost the momentum in switching the roles and that that can almost be on the same level as other content, switching to a different issue.

Interviewer: Now I'm going to talk specifically just about pair programming. Can you describe a situation when you would pick pair programming like you would just instantly decide I'd need to use pair for this thing.

[Int3]: Yeah, when I If I’m going to take an issue where I know how to solve most parts of it but I want input from someone else – it could be compliance or I want to have someone’s opinion on the UX or things like that or if it’s something where I feel like I can’t keep all of this in my brain at once it’s usually easier if you have someone with you

Interviewer: Do you think a pair should always consist of developers that are the same competence level?

[Int3]: No, uh, I don't think that's needed. We usually mix up since it's a really good way to get new developers, like experience because If we get a new developer in our team and they are trying to solve something, if they can have an experienced developer with them they can get more help from them but also the experienced developer can get new viewpoints on how to solve stuff. So I think it's good to mix as well, yeah?

Interviewer: There is an ongoing debate between developers and some academics as well, and they say that it's really hard to compare the effectiveness of pair programming, because most of them agree that pair programming doubles the resources, but it doesn't reduce the time required to produce the product by half. So the debate is in between this loss of efficiency compared to the increase in technical knowledge. What's your opinion on this?

[Int3]: Yeah, I haven't thought that much about it, I would say I mean you take up twice the resources but I think you gain that back in the end. And don't really need to review the code, and the risk of the issue coming back from Q&A for defects is much lower, So I think in the end the total amount of time spent and my gut feeling is it's not that the big of a difference.

Interviewer: So moving now to mob programming, in what situation would you use it?

[Int3]: An example that comes to mind is we were designing a view and we we're not sure how we wanted to structure. We had a lot of different opinions, so we had both like two or three developers and we had one person from Q&A, our UX designer and product owner and we could really fast just iterate and move elements around and try different functionalities. You could get everyone’s opinion and test it really fast. Like you know, a mock up since it wasn't a final view every time that you got a feeling for is this going to work or not? And that was really fantastic because development went by really fast and everyone was happy at the end of it with the result

Interviewer: Do you think there's a risk of the team members not participating or not using their full potential while being in a mob?

[Int3]: Yeah, they're probably a risk for it, I haven't felt that we have had that problem, I mean, developers who hasn't participated as actively as have usually been junior developers so they maybe learn something from listening, and people who have felt like I don't bring anything to the table here, they have just left assessment session. So there's a potential risk for it, but we haven't had that problem.

Interviewer: Some experts recommend the use of a facilitator, do you think this role is important or do you think it's better to have a self managed mob?

[Int3]: We had a session with Woody Zuill, where he explained mob programming an facilitated a small sessions and I think it's probably good for getting to know mob programming and to get started. And I think that it's good if someone in the group kind of takes the role of facilitator. I don't think ouu necessarily need to have a person that's only a facilitator. But I think it's good if someone says that all we need to move on or maybe someone else should should take over driving in.

Interviewer: So now trying to sort of compare these two practices when you have to choose between pear and mob for a specific project, what factors do you usually have in mind?

[Int3]: I would say the size and complexity of the issue. If it's only technical difficulty, I would say a pair programming or maybe like 3 developers working together is probably sufficient. But sometimes when there’s a big risk of the acceptance criteria to get a bit fuzzy or that they change during development then it’s really good to have a Mob session where you can have different people. And maybe not for the entire session, but to know that you can always say, oh, we need this person.

Interviewer: When you have a new team member, probably a junior developer, which version of the two practices do you think is better fit?

[Int3]: In my limited experience, I would say pair programming at first at least, because then you can get the one-on-one session and getting into a mob can be pretty daunting if you're really new and you don't know all the other people in the team. So, you can maybe not participate in a mob session but rather spectate.

Interviewer: And now in the last section of the interview I have two concluding questions. Do you think there are any long-term benefits from adopting mop or pair programming? And by that I don't necessarily mean while still being in the team, but like long term for the developer as an individual.

[Int3]: Yeah, I would say that. The people that I’ve talked to that do Mob Programming, in general, are more open, it’s easier for them to accept new ideas or suggestions from other people and also to share what they know. People that only code by themselves tend to keep to themselves, and they don't like outside influences as much. So, I think you’ll probably become a more flexible open person

Interviewer: How do you think these practices can be adapted for remote work in these times?

[Int3]: Uhm, I mean we have, from day one, uh, sitting at home. We did some sort of remote programming and pair programming like you do a slack call or we have a Google meet and we always have an open Google meet where people can join if they want so we can ask people to join if we need their input, and that has worked really well. So it was really easy to adapt to that, I would say.

Interviewer: So those were my questions, but is there anything else that you think I missed, or you think it's important for my research?

[Int3]: I think it's a good to acknowledge that mob programming in especially and pair programming to some extent is something that's not suitable for everyone, like everyone doesn't enjoy it, and that has to be OK. Like it doesn't work if it's forced in my experience.
