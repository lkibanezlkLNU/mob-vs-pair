Interviewer: My name is Lucian, and I am finishing the Bachelor program called Software Technology at Linnaeus University and my thesis is about mob versus pair programming and I'm comparing the two methods from a literature perspective as well as some industry experience, which is where you come in. Do you have any questions about the thesis in the beginning?

[Int4]: I don't think so, no.

Interviewer:  OK cool, so what is your name and what is your role in the company?

[Int4]: My name is [Int4] and I'm a software developer for [company], I work on platform and framework related subjects.

Interviewer: How many years have you worked as a programmer?

[Int4]: Uh, I've been a developer for four and a half - five years. And I've been at [Company] for six or seven months.

Interviewer: Using your own words, how would you define pair programming?

[Int4]: I'd say it's tackling a difficult problem by joining forces with another person where you kind of have different roles. One is the person writing, and the person who who's next to you is focusing more on directing where to go and what problems to solve? So, one person has a more passive role listening and typing while the other one is solving problems.

Interviewer: OK, and how about mob programming?

[Int4]: I'd say it's the same, at least how I've been mob programming, you have the driver who's typing, and you have the navigators who are telling the driver what to do. But I think the difference [between the roles] is much more distinct in mob programming, whereas in pair programming the rules are not that strictly enforced since you're only two persons, while in mob programming, if you don't follow it strictly, it kind of doesn't work.

Interviewer: Can you tell me a quick summary of your experience with either mob or pair programming?

[Int4]: Yes, sure, so for the most part of my career, I've been pair programming a lot and I've used it for problems where I, I or the other person pair programming wasn't completely confident in how we were going to solve something or when. (…) Yeah, like that and used it as a teaching tool for new developers.
Whereas mob programming, we have used more as a way of developing full time. So for pair programming, it's (…)  with a pair we programmed for like one or two sessions, and then we've developed, alone for a few weeks and then we have another issue that we decided to pair program.
Uh, when I've been mob programming we have been going as a team. We by default were mob programming. And we cannot decide - OK, I want to work on something so low, so it's kind of the opposite approach, where with mob programming we have used it as the default and with pair programming is the option.

Interviewer: OK, and how are the two programming practices used inside your company currently?

[Int4]: So right now, when we are working remotely. We have kind of been experimenting with it, so as I said, before we have used mob programming as the default, but recently we split the teams, so we went from 8 developers to 4 so we kind of moved away from the mob programming for now, and they've been doing mostly solo developing and some pair programming.
So at the moment we're kind of doing mostly solo but some pair programming when it's needed or when we feel like we want to work together because most of us enjoy working together.

Interviewer: So now I'm going to move into the middle section where I'm going to put a pair and MOB together and try to see their benefits or disadvantages. My first question is, did you see any changes in the efficiency of programming after adapting MOB and pair? And by efficiency, I mean the amount of good code produced per resource used, which is like how many employers and how many hours.

[Int4]: Yeah, for mob programming I definitely saw an improvement for me. Other than me learning the code standard at my company, once I started, I also learned good coding practices from the more experienced developers. That we have the same coding style in the team improves efficiency because in the long run you will read code more easily and that’s worth a lot. Because in the long run you will read the code more easily and that's worth a lot for me.
When it comes to pair programming, as I said, I've used it mostly as a way of solving difficult problems. So, I don't know if it has improved efficiency. It definitely feels like it improves efficiency, but I can't really tell, be honest.

Interviewer: Yeah, it's a really delicate point that I'm kind of struggling with in my thesis because measuring just the amount of code produced is really not a good measurement for efficiency. So, I always have to argue like the technical benefits, or like the knowledge earned as an argument to prefer this.

[Int4]: Yeah, it's hard to measure it short term because I think the real effects shows in the long perspective where a code base doesn't rot because we as a team collectively improve it with the same code style and so on. Yeah, so I think mob programmed code based would live longer.

Interviewer: Did you see a difference in the number of errors and defects of the resulted code from mob and pair programming compared to individual?

[Int4]: Yes, for sure, mostly because we get the shared knowledge of multiple developers pointing out what tools to use to reduce errors and as I said, when we embraced the code style we will get less errors and you catch the small side effects that you might not have gotten if you were developing by your own.
I would say when I program by myself, I write more errors than when I pair program or mob.

Interviewer: Something that I want to mention is an idea that came from previous interviewees, most of them said that when they use pair programming or mob programming, they don't spend that much time to code reviews. Do you still do code reviews after repair or mob programming?

[Int4]: If the whole team has joined the programming session, we will most likely not review the code. We will do a review on the mob session, but we won’t be doing the regular push to Git and everyone needs to approve, by then we would say just approve it and merge it. For us at least, what we will do is we will write a code we will push it and merge it, and then we will test it directly after, so we’ll go through the whole process from writing code to deploying into production. So yes, we will spend much less time on review, but that is kind of incorporated in the coding.

Interviewer: How did these two practices affect the team from our communication or camaraderie perspective?

[Int4]: Good question, uhm I can only really speak for the pair programming because for mob programming that was started before, I joined [company], so I don't know how the team can work before that. But for pair programming I’ve used it as a way to teach new developers, but also to get to know them, make them comfortable with me and the rest of the team. So, I think it's very effective to build a like a team feeling and confidence in the team. That's how we teach them it's OK to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes so both pair programming, no programming is good for that I think.

Interviewer: I had two interesting different perspectives in the previous interviews, and they were saying that mob programming shouldn't be used as a tool to generate and create teamwork, but a tool that takes advantage of the camaraderie that was already there. Which side do you think you're on?

[Int4]: I mean, most group programming will probably not work if there is not any team feeling or camaraderie already? I think you get what you put in if you put in a team that's kind of not working good together you won't get the good result from a programming so kind of agree with that. But I think it can amplify a good team to be even better. Does that make sense?

Interviewer: Yeah, and do you have any other advantages of group programming, either pair or mob?

[Int4]: I mean, for me the biggest, biggest thing is it's fun. I mean, I'm going to spend 8,9,10 hours doing work I might as well enjoy it and for me mob and pair programming are really fun because I get to code, and I get to socialize with my teammates. I mob programming was not fun no benefits at all would justify it so…

Interviewer: I've heard this point before, although it's kind of hard for me to phrase it correctly. Can you try to describe what fun means to you when coding?

[Int4]: Yeah so, I mean as a developer, you always try to solve problems, and you know when you put that last puzzle piece in, and you feel that accomplishment, when you work as a mob, I feel that that feeling comes more often. You don't get stuck so often and you just get more positive feedback all the time.

Interviewer: Yeah, I uh, I heard the getting stuck less thing a lot, so I think that's that for me as well as like such a big factor in whether I enjoy programming or not. What are the disadvantages of group programming in your opinion?

[Int4]: Well, yeah, there is some problems for the first one, if you have a dysfunctional team, it just won't work it. I think it amplifies the team you already have. So, if you don't trust your team or don't agree with your team decisions, it will just make it worse. And one thing is when you start the mob session, you kind of agree to stick together on the problem, but life doesn't work that way, someone has to pick up the kids and leave early or it comes to work early and did some other comes later and so on. So, you have this problem where you kind of work together, but people can leave and join.
So, if a key person that kind of is driving an idea of what we're developing is leaving. Then maybe the whole mob kind of stops and don't know what to do so I think that's coordination is kind of hard. But uh, if you solve that, I think it's nice.

Interviewer: So now talking specifically about pair programming. In what situation would you pick pair programming? I think you already mentioned the teaching someone.

[Int4]: Teaching someone for sure, uh, some simple problem that I don't want to disturb the whole team. Uh, I just need some guidance, or someone needs some guidance or just when you don't feel like working alone to be honest, and that's what I've been doing recently. I've been doing some solo issues and then I'm like. I haven't talked to someone in three days, so let's call someone up and ask them if they want to do an issue together. That's what I'd be using it for right now.

Interviewer: Do you think a pair should consist of developers at the same level?

[Int4]: Well, not necessarily it depends on what you want to achieve with pair programming. Ah, it can be frustrating to be on a different skill level, if you have for example something that is very simple for one developer and not for the other and, uh the goal is not to teach or something then it can be frustrating to be on both parallel sides because it's kind of easy for the more experienced developer to just take over the show and a less experienced developer doesn't contribute, so if that happens I think you need to see it as a learning opportunity. But if the less experienced developer is not open for that, I think it's a waste of time to pair program.

Interviewer: And what do you think is the biggest risk of using pair programming?

[Int4]: I mean, I think it's kind of what I mentioned right now if you use pair programming. That's a forced tool or something like that that you don't get the benefits of pair programming. I think you kind of need to see pair programming and mob programming as tools you can use to solve problems and apply them where necessary, not for, let's say, a simple task “Add this button to the page” everyone knows how to do that, there's no sense in putting two experienced developers collaborating on that because they won't get input from each other. 

Interviewer: So now we're moving on to mob programming. Can you describe a situation when you would prefer to big mob programming?

[Int4]: Yeah, sure so common issues that we’ve been looking at where I think Mob Programming really helped were when the team took on a new domain. We were going to do the new log-in service, and everyone was kind of walking blindly, then Mob Programming really helped because we looked into the issue and discussed the problems and so on. Another thing would be, like, let's say we have some legacy system that we want to rewrite or make changes to. To actually have someone in the team that knows that legacy service, I think that's a great opportunity to distribute that knowledge to the whole team meanwhile you also improve something.

Interviewer: Yeah, do you think there's the risk of team members to not participate or use their full potential when using MOB programming?

[Int4]: Yes, uh, I do, for example, you could have team members who are testers. Uh, that maybe can’t really contribute to the coding part of an issue, so they might be completely lost during that. But it could also be that some people don't enjoy mob programming, so they tend to become more silent, and guests take a back seat role. So again, if everyone kind of won't need to agree that they want to do this and, uh, the team kind of needs to make sense for mob programming.

Interviewer: Some experts suggest the use of a facilitator. Do you think this is important to have as an external person or someone from the team can take that role?

[Int4]: I can't really say I think it that it's needed. So, and there there's a few different ways to do mob programming, what we've been doing is 1 driver, and the rest are navigators, and we switch on a schedule. We never let anyone skip being a driver or something like that. We asked, go with it and the driver needs to be silent or at least not give voice to any opinions during when he's driver. So, I mean I don't know how other people do mob programming, but that's how we do it.

Interviewer: OK, so now comparing the two practices and trying to sort of give an idea to people when they should pick one or the other. If you have to choose between pair and mob inside the team, what factors do you have in mind?

[Int4]: As I said, the team, how is it working. I mean I think pair programming has a much lower threshold for entry. I think any team or any two team members not even team members, any 2 developers can end up in a pair programming session. While a mob programming, I think at least you need some sort of agreement on how you're going to do mob programming and what rules apply what is OK to do and so on. Pair programming is It can be anything from one person coding and other sitting behind or you can do a switch the driver and so on. So, mob programming probably needs more agreements beforehand. And pair programming is just a get together and start the code.

Interviewer: So when it comes to characteristics of a project like complexity and difficulty, what characteristics would hint you more towards one of the practices?

[Int4]: So definitely a more complex system would fare well with mob programming. Uhm, I think more minds on those issues has been really helpful. But so is pair programming, because the alternative is solo developing and, yeah, it's always nice to have an extra mind on a problem. So, I think both fare well for complex systems.
I, I think it depends more on the type of issue. Uhm, mob programming farewell for larger issues where you got to keep lots in mind, and maybe smaller issues can be pair programming issues. But ah, yeah.
I'm not completely sure, I think both fares well on most issues if they are not just the groundwork.

Interviewer: Which practice do you think is better for onboarding a new team member?

[Int4]: So, in the start I would say pair programming, based on my own experience. In the start at a new company, you can get overwhelmed with all new information and all new people. And, uh, it can be nice to get to know one person. So, I would say pair programming kind of eliminates that feeling of not knowing what to do during your first week. You also get to know someone on the team.
Uh, when I started on [company], I did mob programming, but I already knew a few people in the team beforehand, so that kind of worked great as well.

Interviewer: So, do you feel like maybe there's a lot of pressure if you start with mob programming and you become the driver as a junior?

[Int4]: Yeah, for sure, I mean, I was nervous. The mob programming was new to me, so I didn't know what to expect. But then the team was really nice, so it turned out to be awesome. So, I mean, I guess it's a good alternative, but I would go with pair programming.

Interviewer: Do you think there are any long-term benefits from the two programming practices and by long term? I mean maybe not in the same team, but you as a developer, what did you gain from having these experiences?

[Int4]: Well, I talked earlier about, I think a mob programmed codebase would live longer because the developers learn some good practices for coding, so I think when they do pair programming and mob programming, you're developing your development skills. Uh, you learn what's good coding practices and what's not and you, you share the mistakes, so you cannot amplify your learning. In my mind, I think that's the biggest gain you get.

Interviewer: And do you think these programming practices are less effective now that work is done remotely, or do you think they can be easily adapted to it?

[Int4]:  I think I think, yeah, it gets harder because we're not used to working remotely. I mean, we've worked remotely before, but not in this way, not this much, not all the time. So I think we will adapt to working remotely and still continue with pair programming and mob programming, but it will take time to relearn how to do it effectively.

Interviewer: OK, so there's not any other reason for you stopping using mob programming?

[Int4]: Yeah, I as I said earlier, it gets kind of hard when you start to mob program and then one person leaves. If two persons leave, we are now pair programming and it happens a lot when we work remotely because people have children and have to go and take care of them so it's been hard to mob program, but I'm sure we will continue with it.
