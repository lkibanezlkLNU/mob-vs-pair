Interviewer: What is your name and what is your role in your company?

[Int5]: My name is [Int5] and, uh, I'm a System developer and software engineer.

Interviewer: How many years did you work as a programmer?

[Int5]: Four and a half. 

Interviewer: OK, before we go into the questions for the thesis, do you have any questions or something that not that's not clear about my project.

[Int5]: No, this seems pretty straightforward.

Interviewer: OK, awesome, so using your own words, how would you define pair programming?

[Int5]: Uhm well pair programming is when you basically team up with another person and you try to solve a task together. 

Interviewer: And how about mob programming?

[Int5]: People do it differently I think, and I've heard with definition that you should be the correct number of people under there that also the right people to solve the task and that means that you can be 2 or it can be 7. It doesn't really matter I suppose.

Interviewer: Can you tell me a summary of your experience with both pair and Mob?

[Int5]: Sure, at my last job we did a lot of pair program programming. The small tasks that you can solve yourself and then you more or less should do that because if you do that in the together with someone or more people usually or it's kind of obvious that you're too many. And in a bunch so it's not really effective. Power programming is good, if you are new in the workplace, I think Pair Programming is better suited because you have one person that can more directly tell you how stuff works, and you also can be more active. When it comes to Mob Programming, I found it kind of difficult to get a good grasp of things when I was new. Because yeah, we were a lot of people and we have different experiences, some different.

Interviewer: OK, so how often did you use them? Like, how long did you use pair programming and mob programming?

[Int5]: Well, we used pair programming at my last job, and I was there for almost three years and there we did it like on and off, but maybe half of the time. And mob programming I've been doing now for like 1 1/2 year and we use it, I would say like 90% of the time. Uhm, actually because it's our main way of working. And it's also been like because it's where I'm at now it's we're more or less a startup and it's really decided by people who like to refine the development process and stuff, so people are interested in trying out new things.

Interviewer: So do you have multiple teams that use mob programming or is just one team?

[Int5]: More, I think all teams are using mob programming, but we also we are kind of flexible and I think you really have to be flexible when it comes to mob programming, because it doesn't suit all people as well and also when it comes to this, I mean different kind of tasks, it doesn't suit all tasks to be that many people.

Interviewer: Yeah, so for the next questions I'm going to put both pair and mob programming together and I'm going to refer to them as a group programming. Did you see any changes in the efficiency of programming when adapting these practices? And by efficiency, I mean the amount of good code produced per resource used.

[Int5]: Yeah, definitely. I mean, when I started doing mob programming, I really felt like the iterations were a lot faster. Instead of me writing code and sending to a colleague that could, look at it later and have a discussion and then I'll change some things.

Interviewer: Did you notice any difference in the number of errors or defects in the resulting code?

[Int5]: Definitely, we have fewer errors because when you have more people, I mean in the loop, and I mean it could be just two, but when there are more people in the loop you just pass like a poll across back and forth, then OK, it's I mean the other person can start up the project and try and the and run everything and try all the edge cases but probably they won't. But if they are part of the group, they could get a better grasp of it so I would definitely say that we have fewer bugs also.

Interviewer: How did these two practices affect the team from our communication and camaraderie perspective?

[Int5]: Communication wise, I guess as I said, I mean you don't really have to try to explain stuff as much because you're working with the same things. And camaraderie, I think it's pretty good because it's also up to the other people who's working. I mean, if you, if you like being a powerful group, if you're if you're a team player, then it's a really good way you're working.

Interviewer: Regarding to what you said previously, I've heard an opinion which said that a team shouldn't adopt mob programming if they do not have synergy, because it's just going to make it even worse and it's not going to work. What do you think about this?

[Int5]: OK, uhm yeah there might be a point to that because I've been working in several combinations at my workplace now and if one person doesn't fit, it becomes kind of hard to work with that person, and I mean it's kind of obvious that there's something wrong, so usually then we can break up and try different combinations. 

Interviewer: Can you name any other advantages that group programming has compared to individual programming?

[Int5]: Well, social aspect. You're more involved with your colleagues definitely, and I mean during Corona and during working from home, it's been really, I mean, I don't know if I could have if it wasn't like talking to people and solving problems together with them all day and this isolation really ****

Interviewer: Yeah, I know what you mean I started working recently and I work distance from the beginning, it's not fun. Someone mentioned that mob and group programming are fun. Can you agree with this and if so, how would you define what makes it fun?

[Int5]: I think the fun part is when you're in that stage where you like, when you're discussing like the core problems to solve and then you can have ideas and go back and forth and you might have good idea and someone says, yeah, let's try that and you get this kind of energy from that. That's when it's the most fun thing. But also, you can just start talking about something random and have like a mini break for two minutes where you share a picture or link or something?

Interviewer: Can you name any disadvantages of group programming?

[Int5]: Yeah, definitely. If it's not organic, like if you have like this is the set group now we are these three people and we're working together and we do everything together that's when it's kind of when you attack something that you need to solve and it becomes obvious that maybe you're not the right people for the task or like there are too many, then it's really it's really apparent when one person kind of disappears from the from the conversation. That person starts doing something else, like answering emails or something like that then that's when it's, uh, it's apparent that there's some time wasted from the employee.

Interviewer: Do you have any mitigation strategy for this case like I've talked with some other people, and they say that they before they start a mobbing session, they agree to the fact that if you do not participate you are look like allowed to leave. Do you have a strategy like that or how do you handle the situation?

[Int5]: Yeah, I think that's how you should do it, definitely. And I have done it, but we haven't really said it out loud.

Interviewer: Do you think that a pair should always consist of developers that are around the same skill level?

[Int5]: Uh depends on no, not necessarily because I mean, when it comes to Pair Programming or Mob Programming, one really big advantage I think is the spread of knowledge, you can learn a lot, partly skills, but also how parts of a system that you haven’t worked with before functions. So, I don’t think it’s a bad thing if you’re on different levels. But if your levels are too different it could be a problem because the more experienced person would be kind of frustrated.

Interviewer: And we talked before about the risk of mob programming of people not being engaged. Do you think there, uh, yeah, pair programming comes with such a risk? Or any other kind of risk?

[Int5]: I think the risk is some smaller. Because in the consultation with two people, you can't just be quiet, it's kind of obvious. But yeah, I mean the risk is that it's if it's two people that regularly work together and maybe you don't think like in the same way you don't get this other perspective that might be needed to get better quality.

Interviewer: Yeah, that's an interesting point of view. I am now moving on to mob programming, do you have any characteristic of a project that you that makes you decide to pick mob programming for it? Like is there a specific kind of issues that you would pick mob programming for?

[Int5]: The bigger ones, the kind of things where you have to build something new and maybe kind of complicated or when you have one, you need to do something that touches a lot of parts, maybe you're not working with. If you're working with only like 1 service, it's fine, but if you have to do changes in like 3 services and also like the UI and stuff, maybe you need more people with more that have worked like more and different kind of parts of the system or project. I mean definitely for more complex tasks.

Interviewer: Some experts suggest the use of a facilitator in a mob programming setting do you think this role is important, and if so, would you prefer to have it external of the team or part of the team?

[Int5]: I haven't worked with a facilitator in that way, maybe it's a good idea. I mean, if the team really gets stuck and it happens often, then I definitely think that someone should come from the outside and try to make it work better. I haven't really been in those considerations, but I know that other teams at my work, they kind of they got in there in the team where all the like philosophers are. Yeah, like discussing semantics.

Interviewer: OK, now I want to try to compare the two practices because I'm trying give some sort of guideline on how to pick between the two. If you have to choose between pair and mob, what factors do you have in mind? 

[Int5]: Uh, I still think it boils down to the task like, but I mean if I could decide for every task I need to solve, I would think like OK, what people do we need to be? If I just need to work with this this person, who knows a bit about this and we can solve it together, that's fine. But if we're not that sure, or maybe you have to work on different fronts on different services, then you need to be more people. But also, I mean there is also this thing where you don't make that decision all the time. It's more like OK, how do we usually do it? So, they usually work with and it kind of falls into a way of doing it, which maybe it's not optimal. 

Interviewer: Uh, so you mentioned in the beginning of the interview that pair programming is good to onboard a new employee. When you have the two practices, you would prefer pair programming to get someone up to pace, or would you pick the other one instead?

[Int5]: I would prefer pair programming.

Interviewer: So now it's like the concluding section and the I have two questions here, and these are the last two questions. Do you see any long-term benefits from pair or mob programming and by long term I mean inside the team but also outside of the team when you move to a different team, maybe a new company?

[Int5]: Uhm, well inside a team and for the company and definitely the spread of knowledge, because you become a lot less dependent on one person like that, this person wrote this entire service and lost everything and now he quit. You can really avoid that by being by involving more people in the in writing the code. I'd say so, that's one of the bigger benefits.

Interviewer: And how about for developers as individuals? Would you say they change and a bit after taking part in these practices?

[Int5]: I think there's an opportunity to learn more. I mean it can be small things like how people organize their IDE or stuff like that, but also like larger things like if someone knows a good way to design something, and you haven't done that before and you can pick that up so instead of solving it the best way you know you can really, I think you really can learn a lot.

Interviewer: How do you think these programming practices can be adapted for remote work? Do you think they are effective, or do you think they suffer a bit from the remote aspect?

[Int5]: I think it works pretty well; I don't think it suffers too much. Sometimes it even is easier to instead of like looking at the same screen and trying to point and explain, you can actually draw on the screen. In that way, it might even be easier to have your like your own screen. It's not a problem to work remotely the problem is more like for the team as a whole or for the company as a whole. Like the communication between the mobs suffers because now you become really isolated.

Interviewer: Do you think it makes it easier for participants to leave the mob or stay unfocused or would you say it's quite similar to how it was in person?

[Int5]: I think it’s definitely easier to lose focus, because if you’re not driving you can just go to the browser and start scrolling instead; pick up your phone or something
