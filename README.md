The transcripts were automatically generated with the Microsoft Office Word "Transcribe" tool. 
They were "sanitized" in order to make them more readable with a focus on arguments that were inserted in the research report, however, since they were generated with an automated tool, they can still contain words/phrases that were not transcribed properly.
